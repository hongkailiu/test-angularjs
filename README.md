mvc for frontend
- model: json object as data
- view: dom elements
- controller: java script

1. REST data pull
  $http to get a public rest service
2. Model data binding 
  usually defined in input and used in other tags
3. Directives 
  ng-* attributes which extend html by angularjs
4. Utilization of all that within a CSS framework like bootstrap (need some hint)
5. Services 
  existing ones like $http, $scope, $location, self-defined ones like myService
6. Scope utilization demonstration
7. Controllers
8. rootScope and scope difference (read some doc on this topic ... no clear feeling yet)
